Send "Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Have a Nice Dream" Ringtone to your Cell Death the Kid you know how it is,
Hate to dismiss any mistake,
If it ain't right then you must be kiddin',
Joke's mislead because you now slippin'.

Oh believe my dedicated fix,
Simply blast it, it ain't a trick,
Just one click, then a second click,
Rest is oh my goodness you're history.

You don't really need a history, to entry, just then I'm not so intrigued,
Don't get it wrong sir, I'm a sweet treat,
BANG BANG BANG BANG, have a nice dream.
If it ain't proper it's incomplete,
You might give a shimmer because you like the heat.
Stop takin' chances, it's real steep,
Watch where you step, because I'm gunna scream.

????

Not enough for me to satisfy,
Any mistakes? Let's clarify.
Let's post it to classify,
Find your bad and BOOM BAP BAP,
Do it together with my entourage,
Please stick your head in the back [of] the garage,
I'm gunna have a sale and sell you cheap,
Please get out, your out of my league!

????

So intrigued...

You still don't understand the man that your stinging,

I ain't playin'

No more trainin'

Losing; it ain't easy to get back,

You know what I'm sayin'

Hit your face with a big back slap,
Click the cap and go Blap Blap Blap,
Everything you touch will go flat, You know?
Somehow people figure I'm in it.
