Born and raised in Niagara Falls, Canada, Joel Zimmerman (aka "deadmau5") has become one of the most sought-after artists on the electronic music scene in recent times. He is known for his highly entertaining live gigs, often performing wearing a large cartoon mouse head.

He first started his career as co-producer of the Niagara Falls radio show "The Party Revolution" (101.1 The Planet). After gaining exposure to all the many facets of electronic music, Joel then moved on to collaborate with many other artists and record labels around the world.

In 2005, deadmau5 released his first album, "Get Scraped." His latest album is "4x4=12," released in 2010.

He has worked with a number of artists both underground and mainstream - including Melleny Melody, Orgy, Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire of Pendulum, Skrillex, and Steve Duda.

'Deadmau5', Zimmermans' DJ name, originates from an incident where a mouse crawled into his computer and died. He then posted on an internet forum of his shenanigans, and the members began calling him TheDeadMouseGuy. 'Dead Mouse' was too long for an IRC login name, so he abbreviated it to "deadmau5".

He has also done collaborations with top names such as Chris Lake, Glenn Morrison and Wolfgang Gartner.

January 2, 2012: On his birthday, Deadmau5 began his year long residency at XS Night Club in Las Vegas, NV.
