2. Supercell Project aka DJ Supercell is Beat Fehlmann, born 10 Oct 1984, living in Olten(SO), Switzerland He started his musical career at the age of 11 with taking Keyboard-Lessons and playing Music at several School Parties. At the Keyboard-Lessons and at the little homestudio of a friend were the first self-made tracks born. The fascination in electronic music tools, the love to all kind of electronic music and growing up in the trance-scene has made him to a real sound-freak. In the year 1999, he got infected by the psychedelic trance music-scene and until today he spent a lot of time in this with organise parties, deejaying and of course creating psychedelic trance music. In 2006, with the new studio, he started the SUPERCELL PROJECT, in which he puts all the earned know-how last years live on stage and in the studio. The result is a higher quality production and a diversified live show.
